# GENLOG-clean
 
 Modified and updated code from the GENLOG paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05462 as part of my seminar at RWTH Aachen.
 
Run the main.py file by selecting the log file, metrics in the log file to be analysed and measures used for analysis. The code contains three algorithms: LSTM, Neural-prophet and ARIMA; the user can also select which algorithm to use (all algorithms are used by default).
